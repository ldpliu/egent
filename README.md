## üìã Motivation & Overview

Modern programming tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Augment Code, and Cline all feature powerful "agent modes" that can automatically complete complex tasks based on natural language instructions:

- Updating package dependencies and addressing CVE vulnerabilities
- Performing routine code refactoring across multiple files
- Adding unit tests for new or existing functionality
- Standardizing code formatting and fixing linting issues

However, these capabilities face a critical limitation: **context sharing**.

### The Problem

- Each team member uses different tools (Cursor, Cline, etc.)
- Natural language "playbooks" exist only in individual environments
- No centralized way to share, version, or collaboratively improve these playbooks
- Playbook silos form as team members develop their own agent instructions

### The Solution: playbookmcp

playbookmcp converts GitHub repository-based playbooks into an MCP Server that all mainstream programming tools support. This enables:

- **Collaborative editing** of playbooks through standard GitHub workflows
- **Version control** for your team's playbooks
- **Immediate sharing** of new capabilities across the entire team

For example, when engineer Alice adds a new playbook for "Updating dependency versions across the monorepo," commits it to the playbook repo, and pushes, engineer Bob immediately gains access to this capability in his preferred coding tool.

## üîç Design

Your team can continuously enrich the knowledge base by editing the playbook-repo (typically a GitHub repository), enabling AI to automatically complete various tasks.

For playbook repository structure details, see [docs/playbook.md](docs/playbook.md).

## üöÄ How to Use

### Setup

#### Basic Configuration

To use playbookmcp with a remote playbook repository:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playbookmcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "playbookmcp@latest",
        "--playbook-repo",
        "<your playbook repo>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Local Development

For testing with a local context directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playbookmcp-local": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "playbookmcp@latest",
        "--playbook-path",
        "<your playbook files path>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### PlaybookMCP Development

For developing PlaybookMCP itself:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playbookmcp-dev": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "build/index.js",
        "--playbook-path",
        "<your playbook files path>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use `inspector` to inspect the MCP resources:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js --playbook-repo <your playbook repo>
```

### Chat with Your Code-Agent

Below is an example configuration in Cursor:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playbookmcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "playbookmcp@latest",
        "--playbook-repo",
        "git@github.com:xuezhaojun/PlaybookMCP-demo.git"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The first command must be `pb_start` to initiate interaction:

```
pb_start Say Hi to playbookmcp.
```

Or more specific:

```
use MCP tool pb_start Say hi to playbookmcp.
```

Your code-agent will then add a comment on this [issue](https://github.com:xuezhaojun/PlaybookMCP-demo/issues/2).
